**Output**: 
- "The phrasal verb 'give up' consists of the verb 'give' and the preposition 'up'. The verb 'give' often implies transferring or yielding something. The preposition 'up' can indicate a movement to a higher position or a point of completion. When combined in 'give up', the meanings merge into the concept of yielding or surrendering effort, thus forming the meaning: 'to stop trying to do something, often because it is too difficult.' For instance, in the example 'After several failed attempts, she decided to give up trying to learn French,' the phrase indicates a cessation of efforts due to challenges."
